# Reptils

This project was made during my learning process at Infotep. It's about a static website which provides information about certain types of reptiles.
Here, I practiced concepts like crud, asynchrony, by using http requests to store information in MySQL or retrieve it from it.

## Technologies used:
- PHP
- JAVASCRIPT
- HTML
- CSS

## HOW TO INSTALL
- Download the zip file, clone or fork the repository. Use git clone https://github.com/Felix72396/reptils.
- Inside backend folder you'll see a __.sql__ file called __reptiles_db__. Import this file into MySQL.
- Use a package manager like Xampp, Laragon or so to run the app.
